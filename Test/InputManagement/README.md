The Update method of ScreenManager returns an InputState Object.

InputState specifies the position of the mouse as well as a List of Actions.

An Action is either an action that can be performed by Input from the mouse
(e.g. what mouse button has been clicked)

of an action that can be performed by Input from the Keyboard,
in which case the actions are already mapped to Actions which are specific to the game.
